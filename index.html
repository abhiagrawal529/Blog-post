                <h2>Introduction Of Optical Computing</h2>
                <p class="main-text">
                    An optical computer is a computer that uses photons in visible light or IR beams to perform digital computation .
                    Today's Optical computer known as Electric-optical-hybrid computer in which data is received by electron and transferred by Optics .
                    In silicon computers, the speed of computers was achieved by miniaturizing electronic components.

                    It is also estimated that the number of transistor switches that can be put onto a chip doubles every 18 months.

                    So further miniaturization of size introduces several problems such as dielectric breakdown, hot carriers, and quantum tunelling etc.

                <h2>More about Optical Computers!</h2>
                <p class="main-text">
                    Albert Einstein says : speed of light is 3*10^8  meter per second  which is about 3 lakh km per second. So if we can make a computer with light it will be faster than  anyone can ever think of.
                    Since light contains photons and they are mass less so they travel with speed of light.
                    Optical computing was the hot research topic in 1980â€™s but for the limitation of materials it was not implemented. A. Huang and his colleagues at Bell Laboratories have actually built  a computer. 
                <h2>Current work and improvent</h2>
               <p class="main-text">
                <strong>By NASA</strong>
                    The thin films being developed.
                    Can perform switching, signal processing and frequency doubling
                NASA have developed and built all-optical logic gate circuits for data processing.<br>
                <strong>By lightmatter</strong>
                Lightmatter is building a photonic computer for the biggest growth area in computing right now, and according to CEO Nick Harris, it can be ordered now and will ship at the end of this year. It's already much faster than traditional electronic computers a neural nets, machine learning for language processing, and AI for self-driving cars.
                It's the world's first general purpose photonic AI accelerator, and with light multiplexing -- using up to 64 different colors of light simultaneously
